The JMP instruction can be used for implementing loops. Fer example, the following code snippet can be used for executing the 
loop-body 10 times.
	MOV CL, 10
	L1:
	<LOOP-BODY>
	DEC CL
	JNZ L1
	
The processor instruction set, however, includes a group of loop instructions for implementing iteration. The basic LOOP
instruction has the following syntax
	LOOP label

Where, label is the target label that identiffies the target instruction as in tyhe jump instructions. The LOOP instruction assumes
that the ECX register contains the loop count. When the loop instruction is executed, the ECX register is decremanted and the
control jumps to the targer label, until the ECX rtegister value, i.e., the counter reaches the value zero.

The above code snippet could be written as:
	mov ECX, 10
	l1:
	<loop body>
	loop l1
