Assembler Features

* Basic data types
    - Integers
        > data of 1, 2 or 4 bytes
        > data and directions (pointers)
    - Reals (floating point): 4,8 or 10 bytes
    - Does not include structured types
        > They are encoded as contiguously stored data
        > It has addressing modes to manipulate them

* Primitive Operations 
    - Arithmetic/logical operations on registers and data in memory
    - Data transfer between  memory and register bank
    - Conditional and unconditional jumps (to/from procedures)

Programmer Vision

* What do we need to study?
    - Memory space
    - Available registers
    - Set of instructions: what they do, how they are coded, how long they take...
    - Types and representation of data
    - Addressing modes
    - Instruction sequencing
    - Communication with the outside
